# Asynchronous Actors for Message Bus

Mockintosh offers "Mock Actor" approach for using with asynchronous message bus technologies, such as Kafka, RabbitMQ and Redis. "Mock Actor" approach requires you to provide deployed message bus instance, and configure valid address for it inside configuration file.

Each Mock Actor is an entity that can be configured for producing or consuming messages, or both. Management API provides important synergies to work with Mock Actors.

Below are the configuration patterns for Mock Actors:

## Scheduled Producer

## On-Demand Producer

## "Reactive" Producer

## Validating Consumer
