# Management API

Mockintosh allows to control it in-flight with several "management API" endpoints. Through requests to those endpoints,
you can fetch some information about mock service state, as well as change parameters and configuration. This comes
useful if you want to use Mockintosh as part of test automation, where each test case uses different mock fixture.

Management API is disabled by default. There are two ways to enable management API: global at separate port, or
per-service with service's port reused. The latter is convenient when you can't afford exposing another port, for
example from inside Kubernetes or cloud environment.

To enable global management API, consider this config example with top-level `management` section:

```yaml
management:
  port: 8000
  # ssl: true
  # sslCertFile: "subdir/cert.pem",
  # sslKeyFile: "subdir/key.pem",
```

Uncommenting SSL settings will enable SSL on that port, just like with [service's SSL settings](#ssl-support).

You can access global API of above settings via url like `http://localhost:8000`.

To enable management API on service level, you need to specify `managementRoot` property, which will designate URL path
at which management API endpoints will be accessed:

```yaml
services:
  - name: Mgmt demo
    managementRoot: __admin
```

You can access service's management API of above settings via url like `http://localhost:8001/__admin`.

## Minimalistic UI

When you open root URL of management API in browser, it displays you a minimalistic HTML page, allowing to access some
API actions through UI.

## Getting and Setting Mock Config

With management API, you can retrieve current configuration by requesting `config` path.

Also, you can issue a POST call into same endpoint, to dynamically set the config. The format for POST payload is same
as you retrieve via GET. There are some restrictions on what can be changed live. Generally, you can only
change `endpoints` contents.

The `/config` endpoint can return YAML format, when queried with `format` parameter `GET /config?format=yaml`.
`POST /config` endpoint also supports YAML as the payload.

`POST /config` endpoint not only supports changing how the services respond to the requests but also supports changing
the [global settings](Configuring.md#global-settings) of the configuration file.

## Getting Service Statistics

By requesting `stats` path of management API, you can get information on how many requests were served by Mockintosh,
each service and each endpoint inside service. Also, the statistics of response statuses will be available, as well as
average processing time.

You can reset these stats by issuing `DELETE` call on same path.

## Resetting Iterators

- You can reset positions of [dataset](#datasets) and [multi-response](#multiple-responses) endpoints, by
  issuing `POST /reset-iterators` request.

## Unhandled Requests

If management API is enabled, Mockintosh will record all requests that are not found in configured endpoints. You can
get config prototype for these endpoints by querying `GET /unhandled` in management API.

The `/unhandled` endpoint can return YAML format, when queried with `format` parameter `GET /unhandled?format=yaml`.
`POST /unhandled` endpoint also supports YAML as the payload.

## OAS Serving

Specifically for HTML UI, there is `GET /oas` that returns autogenerated OpenAPI specification for service (or services)
. In UI, the most useful is ability to "try now" the mocked endpoint.

Also, you can specify existing OAS document for service like this:

```yaml
services:
  - name: Mgmt demo with OAS
    managementRoot: __admin
    oas: '@path/to/service.oas.json'
```

## Resources

It's possible to CRUD the resource files used in the configuration file (the paths starts with `@`) using `/resources`
endpoint. This endpoint accepts `GET`, `POST` and `DELETE` requests and operates on paths relative to the
configuration file's parent directory otherwise it return a `4xx`. Also the files referenced in the such requests are
required to be defined with `@` prefix in the configuration file before hand. The directories are automatically
created or deleted for the given paths.

### Reading

`GET /resources` returns the list of paths to the externals files used in the configuration file.

`GET /resources?path=somedir/myfile.txt` reads the files and returns its text.

`GET /resources?path=somedir/myfile.txt&format=stream` returns the file as an octet stream (downloads the file).

### Creating/Updating

`POST /resources -F 'path=somedir/myfile.txt' -F 'file=hello world'` creates the directory `somedir/` if it
does not exist, updates the file `myfile.txt` if it exists otherwise creates it and puts `hello world` text
into that file. `path` and `file` parameters are required in form data requests.

`POST /resources -F 'somedir/myfile.txt=@myfile.txt'` also works in the same way but this time it's a multipart request
and `path` parameter is not required. If `path` parameter is supplied then it works as a parent directory path
for the path specified in the files' key: `POST /resources -F 'path=somedir/' -F 'myfile.txt=@myfile.txt'`.

*Note: Leading forward slashes (`/`) are ignored and name-inode maps like `.`, `..` are supported in the path.*
*But it always operates in paths relative to the configuration file's parent directory.*

### Deleting

`DELETE /resources?path=somedir/myfile.txt` removes the file `myfile.txt`. Also removes the directory `somedir/`
if it's empty after the removal of the file. If `keep=true` query argument is supplied then it does not
remove the parent directories. Otherwise it removes the empty directories by unfolding from the referenced
file's parent directory to the directory that contains the configuration file.

## Traffic Logs

Traffic logging records the details of every incoming requests and their corresponding responses. Traffic logging
is disabled by default. To enable it; send the request `POST /traffic-log -F 'enable=true'` to the related service-level
or global-level management endpoint.

To access the logs one can send a `GET` request to `/traffic-log` management endpoint. This endpoint returns the logs
in **HTTP Archive 1.2 (HAR)** format. The logs can be retrieved separately based on service-level or as a whole on
global-level based on the management endpoint that you're requesting to.

To clean up the logs; simply send a `DELETE` request to `/traffic-log` management endpoint. Similar to `GET` request,
`DELETE` also operates on both service-level and global-level. `DELETE` endpoint returns the logs just before the
clean up operation is performed.

## Setting Current Tag

For the [tagged responses](Configuring.md#tagged-responses), you can get currently active tag, or set one. Issuing `GET /tag` will
report currently active tag, doing `POST /tag` will set one. For `POST`, just place desired name of the
tag into raw request body. Empty tag set means "no active tag". Alternatively you can use the `current` query parameter
instead of the raw request body like: `POST /tag?current=tagname` to set the active tag.

The payload for `POST /tag` management endpoint can be a list of tags that's
comma-separated like: `POST /tag?current=tagname1,tagname2`
