# Next Version

- special matching options for GraphQL
- improve OAS converter

# Roadmap Ideas

## Async Mock Actors

- avro/grpc/binary/str problem in Kafka
- what to do with binary headers in Kafka? data-url prefix?
- interceptors to access kafka comms
- allow overriding on-demand producer fields via mgmt API
- support dead letter topic for Google PubSub
- serve AsyncAPI document?

## Management API/UI

- save modified config in mgmtUI somehow to disk
- have a mark for "unhandled" entries in traffic log, allow adding these entries to config with one click
- fix issue of unhandled traffic JSON shown as base64
- find solution better than querying traffic log each second
- In unhandled tab, height: calc(100vh - 150px); does not work well when text is long
- upon navigating between mgmt UI tabs, refresh unhandled, stats
- config editor to provide hyperlinks from resource files into corresponding editing
- allow enabling multiple tags + allow response to trigger tag up/down => state machine for complex scenarios

## Other

- Better way to support GraphQL

- Nicer logging of requests, with special option to enable it.
- Nicer formatted error pages for known errors, explaining the problem

- Tornado has auto-multicpu startup mode, use it optionally with CLI arg/env var
- test the performance of ourself and optimize it


- support fragment same way we support query string - both in `path` and as standalone `fragment` option
- add support of array/list parameters on query strings like
  `/service2q?a=b&a=c` or `/service2q?a[]=b&a[]=c` and form data with multiple values for the same key to the request
  matching logic

- mocks for gRPC servers?

- gatsby-style approach to telemetry
- urlparse as helper
- CSS selector helper for HTML
- a service-level field to specify base path of the API for `/v1` and `/v2` things
