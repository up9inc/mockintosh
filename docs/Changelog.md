# Roadmap

## Next Version

- YAML format for unhandled requests
- get rid of default config that runs with no params
- allow editing resource files via mgmt API/UI
- "Hello. I'm Mockintosh" in `x-mockintosh-prompt` header
- traffic log API & viewer
- mgmt UI change config global section didn't work
- report error in case config apply fails
- "fallback" mode for service to learn configuration

- bug of applying status change via UI (Alon)
- \r vs \n problem in mac
- change config editor component

- don't clear traffic log on page reload

- add support of array/list parameters on query strings like
`/service2q?a=b&a=c` or `/service2q?a[]=b&a[]=c` and form data
with multiple values for the same key to the request matching logic


# Ideas

- Nicer formatted error pages for known errors
- admin UI to show available tags and allow switching  
- Import from OpenAPI and Postman collections `cat OpenAPI.json | mockintosh > mockintosh-config.yml`
1. base64-encoded body strings, for binary responses
1. Content-Length that self-maintains, unless chunked transfer (default), some other magical HTTP protocol things (
   Accept etc)

- mocks for Kafka & RabbitMQ
  - https://github.com/spotify/docker-kafka - self-contained, maybe https://hub.docker.com/r/solsson/kafka/
  - on schedule producer
  - on demand producer
  - reactive consumer+producer
  - consumer fact validation
  - avro + grpc + JSON 
- mocks for gRPC servers
