# Next Version

TODO:

- mocks for Kafka & RabbitMQ
    - on schedule producer
    - on demand producer
    - reactive consumer+producer
    - consumer fact validation
    - global headers considered
    - avro + grpc + JSON
    - what to do with binary headers?
    - bodies from file
    - traffic log to display kafka comms
    - interceptors to access kafka comms
    - stats to count kafka comms
    - allow overriding on-demand producer fields via mgmt API
    - config reloading to work

1. Display timestamps in traffic log
1. Do not respond with Content-Type=text/html if no content-type header is configured

# Roadmap Ideas

- unhandled requests to not get into traffic log?
- add toggle to enable unhandled requests capture. Otherwise, we get OOMed easily.
- upon navigating between mgmt UI tabs, refresh unhandled, stats
- Tornado has auto-multicpu startup mode, use it optionally  

- support fragment same way we support query string - both in `path` and as standalone `fragment` option
- cli argument to set the tag
- add support of array/list parameters on query strings like
  `/service2q?a=b&a=c` or `/service2q?a[]=b&a[]=c` and form data with multiple values for the same key to the request
  matching logic
- Nicer formatted error pages for known errors
- Nicer debug logging of requests
- admin UI to show available tags and allow switching
- Import from OpenAPI and Postman collections `cat OpenAPI.json | mockintosh > mockintosh-config.yml`
- config editor to provide hyperlinks from resource files into corresponding editing

1. base64-encoded body strings, for binary responses
1. Content-Length that self-maintains, unless chunked transfer (default), some other magical HTTP protocol things (
   Accept etc)

- SQS as one more async tech

- mocks for gRPC servers
